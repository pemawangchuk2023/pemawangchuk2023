🤠 Who Am I?

👋 Hello! I'm a passionate, and strong believer of self-learning. I am finance by professional and programming by interest, and I am aiming to combine both the skills. 

📜 Bitcoin Historian

🌍 Deeply intrigued by Bitcoin's revolutionary journey, I dive into its history, evolution, and transformative impact. Uncovering the mysteries surrounding Satoshi Nakamoto and the innovations by pioneers like Nick Szabo fuels my curiosity.

🎯 My Mission

🎓 My goal is clear, to keep learning accounting, smart contract, and web development with specific focus on TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and Solidity and framework like NextJS and Tanstack Start. 

🌱 Currently Learning

📚 The journey never ends! I'm deeply immersed in:

🌐 Next.js – Crafting dynamic and efficient web experiences

📜 Solidity – Bringing smart contracts to life with creativity and precision

⚙️ TypeScript & JavaScript – Building robust, scalable solutions for complex challenges

Let's code, innovate, and shape the decentralized future together! 🚀✨
